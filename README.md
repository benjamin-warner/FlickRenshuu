Flick Renshuu, where flick is the name of the Japanese 12-key style mobile keyboard, and Renshuu (練習）is the Japanese word for practice. It's pretty much like those typing games you may have played in elementary and/or middle and high school. I originally decided to make this because most Japanese use the Flick keyboard, and it is more efficient. However, I am awful at using it, and if I try to message my friends with it for practice, my replies are always too slow and I become frustrated and switch back to phonetic input with a QUERTY keyboard.

Currently have long-term plans for this, but for now I want to produce a stable release. This will be having visually appealing layouts, a settings menu, and socring.
